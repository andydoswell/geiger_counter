Arduino sketches for triple tube and single tube Geiger counters

Hardware design can be found on my website https://andydoz.blogspot.com/2020/07/not-triple-tube-geiger-counter.html

Triple tube sketch is likely to have many errors. See blog for details.


Version 2.0 has a faster response time, and runs on the same hardware. Updated 10 Mar 2022
